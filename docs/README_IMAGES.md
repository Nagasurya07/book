Screenshots for README

Place the UI screenshots here so the top-level `README.md` can display them.

Expected filenames:

- `docs/screenshots/login.png` — login page screenshot
- `docs/screenshots/dashboard.png` — dashboard screenshot

To add the screenshots:

1. Create `docs/screenshots/` (if not present).
2. Save your images using the file names above.
3. Commit and push.

Example:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/screenshots
# copy images into docs/screenshots/
git add docs/screenshots/*.png
git commit -m "Add screenshots for README"
git push
```

If you want me to add the exact screenshots you provided earlier, upload the image files to `docs/screenshots/` and I will commit them for you.
